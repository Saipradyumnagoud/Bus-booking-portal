# Bus Booking Application

This project is a simple Bus Booking Application built with React. It allows users to select a bus, enter their details, specify the number of passengers, and confirm the booking. The total price is dynamically calculated based on the number of passengers and the bus fare per passenger.

## Features

- Displays bus details, including route, departure time, price, and available seats.
- Allows users to specify the number of passengers.
- Collects individual passenger names.
- Calculates the total fare dynamically.
